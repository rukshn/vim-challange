I always wanted to learn Vim. I tried switching to vim several times. Every time when I tried to use Vim I get scared or dishartened and switch back to VSCode or Sublime Text. 

I know the learning curve is steep, and it's not as easy as using VSCode, where you just install and go. But I'm sure if I put on some effort during my spare time I might be able to learn it for good. 

I'm not sure if I will be able to replace Vim with my routine editor VSCode, but let's see how it goes.

In this Repo I'm trying to write, and also save my Vim journey for future references as well as anyone else who finds this repo wanting to learn vim.
