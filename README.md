# The Vim Challange

I always wanted to learn Vim. I tried switching to vim several times. Every time when I tried to use Vim I get scared or dishartened and switch back to VSCode or Sublime Text.

I know the learning curve is steep, and it's not as easy as using VSCode, where you just install and go. But I'm sure if I put on some effort during my spare time I might be able to learn it for good.

I'm not sure if I will be able to replace Vim with my routine editor VSCode, but let's see how it goes.

In this Repo I'm trying to write, and also save my Vim journey for future references as well as anyone else who finds this repo wanting to learn vim.

This is how my current vim setup looks like

## Vim or NeoVim

I decided to go with NeoVim because it think it's more actively developed and has some features such as LSP out of the
box.

Even though LSP support is currently not stable, I think in future it will be great.

However, you can use the same init.vim file that I use for NeoVim on your Vim text editor as well.

You can check out my init.vim file here - https://github.com/rukshn/vim-challange/blob/main/init.vim

Credit goes to Martin Toma, I have forked his init.vim file and changed it to my flavour by adding some plugins and
removing some. Since I'm mainly interested in Javascript and web development I thought Martin Toma's init file is a
good starting point.
